::: {#intro-heading}
Greetings and salutations! My name is Shen Rothermel and I am currently a Junior at St. Olaf College in Northfield, working towards my Computer Science & Mathematics degree. My hobbies are numerous, but amongst them are anime, gaming, coding, and hanging out with my friends! I also immensely enjoy cats. Cats are very important.
